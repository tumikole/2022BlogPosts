# Introduction

On this blog post i'm going to talk Chai and how to test your code/application.

# Body

So chai is the JS testing library which helps you establish that your your programs still behaves the way expect it to after the changes to your code.  It provides functions and methods that help you compare the output of a certain test with its expected value.

So when you write your tests, you are writing tests that  describe your program's requirements and see if your program meets them.

First thing you need to don is to install chai as a library and save them as dev dependencies to your packages then change test script of the packages.
