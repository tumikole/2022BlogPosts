# Introduction

Today im going to talk about what i have been doing on friday.

# Body

Today i was busy with helping junior students about HTML and CSS. I gave them a 2 hour project to do and to see if they understand. The student were suppose to build an app that takes to images and two paragraphs. On bigger screens the images and paragraphs should be displayed flex/rows and on smaller screens should they should be displayed in columns. 

So after the students were done with the project, i went to each student individually and check they're project and give them feedback and also gave them tutorial and explain every step of the project.

# Conclusion

The project helped me a lot because it helped me to learn more about css and html
