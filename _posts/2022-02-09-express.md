Express it makes it easier to create a server and it handles routing for applications, which handles things like direct people to the correct pages when they visit a certain endpoint.

Express also helps you to respond  to requests with route support so that  you may write responses to specific URL's.

So for express to work on your code editor you need to install the following packages...


1. npm init
npm init it initializes your project.
ex:
. The project's name
. The project's version
. The project's description
. The project's entry point
. The project's test command
. The project's git repository
. The project's keywords
. The project's license

2. express
ex: 
npm install express


3. nodemon
npm install nodemon# Conclusion

and others like cors, bodyParser, mongoose etc
